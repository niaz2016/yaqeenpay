Backend Implementation Plan
1. Implement Wallet System
The current implementation lacks a complete wallet system, which is a core component of the platform. The system needs to support:

Wallet creation for buyers and sellers
Top-up functionality via different payment channels
Balance checking and transaction history
Ledger entries for all wallet transactions
2. Implement User Management and KYC
While basic authentication exists, the system needs enhanced user management:

2.1. User Identity and Authentication Enhancement:
- Extend the ApplicationUser model with additional profile fields
- Implement JWT token management with proper refresh token rotation
- Add role-based authorization (Buyer/Seller/Admin)
- Implement email verification during registration

2.2. KYC Process Implementation:
- Create KYC document model (CNIC, business registration, etc.)
- Implement document upload functionality with secure storage
- Add document verification status tracking
- Create admin verification interface
- Implement verification history and audit trail

2.3. User Profile Management:
- Extended profile information (address, contact details, preferences)
- Profile completeness tracking
- Profile image management
- User activity history

2.4. Seller Onboarding Workflow:
- Multi-step seller registration process
- Business profile creation (business type, category, description)
- Document verification workflow
- Seller rating and review system
- Approval/rejection process with feedback mechanism

2.5. Admin User Management:
- User search and filtering
- User status management (active, suspended, restricted)
- Manual KYC verification interface
- User impersonation for support purposes
- Activity logs and audit trails
3. Extend Order Lifecycle Management
The current order implementation covers basic creation and completion, but needs to include:

Shipping status updates
Delivery confirmation
Order rejection by buyer
Dispute handling
Integrating with the complete state machine described in the project overview
4. Implement Escrow Refund Functionality
The escrow system needs to handle refunds when:

Orders are rejected
Disputes are resolved in favor of the buyer
Cancellations occur
5. Implement Withdrawal System
Currently missing is the withdrawal functionality for sellers to:

Request withdrawals to external payment methods
Track withdrawal status
Handle settlement/failure outcomes
6. Implement Admin Dashboard API
Admin functionality is largely missing and needs to include:

Seller approval
Dispute resolution
System monitoring
Manual ledger adjustments
Fee configuration
7. Integrate Payment Service Providers
The platform needs real payment integration:

JazzCash/Easypaisa/Bank transfer for wallet top-up
Provider-specific adapters
Webhook handlers for asynchronous confirmations
8. Implement Notifications System
A complete notification system is needed for:

Email notifications
SMS notifications
In-app notifications for various events
9. Implement OTP Verification
Enhanced security with OTP verification for:

Registration
Login
Sensitive operations (withdrawals, etc.)
10. Complete Background Job Processing
Background processing using Hangfire or Quartz.NET for:

Auto-release timers
Reconciliation jobs
Notification dispatching
11. Enhance Security and Authentication
Additional security measures:

Rate limiting
IP-based restrictions
Refresh token rotation
Secure JWT handling
12. Implement Analytics and Reporting
Reporting functionality for:

Key metrics (escrow completion rate, RTO reduction)
Wallet conversion
Financial reconciliation
